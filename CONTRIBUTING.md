2.4. Writing Code

Code contributions are at the heart of an open-source project. We encourage you to contribute to the T100-DB codebase.
Getting Started with Code Contributions (High-Level)

As T100-DB is in its foundational development phase, the core codebase (src/) is under active development. More detailed setup instructions will follow as the project matures. However, here's a general outline of the process:

    Fork the Repository: Start by forking the T100-DB/src repository on GitHub to your personal account.

    Clone Your Fork: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/T100-DB.git
    cd T100-DB

    Set Upstream: Add the original T100-DB repository as an "upstream" remote.

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/T100-DB/T100-DB.git

    Create a New Branch: Always create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name (e.g., feature/add-vector-search, bugfix/fix-wal-issue).

    git checkout -b your-feature-branch-name

    Make Your Changes: Implement your bug fix, feature, or documentation improvement.

        Our core engine is primarily written in Julia.

        The API layer is in Python.

        CLI and tooling are in Go.

        Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding style (under review).

        Write clear, concise comments where necessary.

    Test Your Changes: (Detailed testing guidelines will be provided later as the project matures). Ensure your changes do not introduce new bugs and ideally include new tests for new features or bug fixes.

    Commit Your Changes: Write clear, descriptive commit messages.

    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add descriptive commit message for your changes"

    Push to Your Fork:

    git push origin your-feature-branch-name

    Create a Pull Request (PR):

        Go to your forked repository on GitHub.

        You should see a prompt to create a Pull Request from your new branch to the main branch of the T100-DB/T100-DB repository.

        Provide a detailed description of your changes in the PR, referencing any related issues.

        Our core maintainers will review your PR, provide feedback, and work with you to get your changes merged.
