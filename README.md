T100-DB: The World's First Truly AI-Native Database
Welcome to T100-DB

T100-DB is a groundbreaking, high-performance, distributed vector database engineered from the ground up to serve as the foundational data layer for the era of artificial intelligence. We are building a new class of database designed to eliminate the performance bottlenecks and architectural compromises that currently hold back modern AI applications, providing a unified, efficient, and powerful platform for both operational and analytical workloads.
Our Mission and Vision

Our core mission is to develop, foster, and sustain an open-source, high-performance, distributed vector database architected to address the unprecedented scale and latency demands of modern AI workloads. This includes, but is not limited to, generative AI, large-scale scientific computing, and real-time analytics.

We envision T100-DB becoming an essential, trusted, and foundational piece of infrastructure that empowers the next generation of scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. We believe the industry needs a database conceived for this new reality, and the time for it is unequivocally now.
Why T100-DB?

For years, developers have been forced to build their AI stacks on fragmented data systems—a "Frankenstein" approach leading to immense operational complexity, data synchronization issues, and performance ceilings. T100-DB solves this by offering a single, coherent system that natively understands the data and query patterns of modern AI, particularly the crucial role of vector embeddings.

The world is experiencing a Cambrian explosion of generative AI and large language models. The demand for real-time, intelligent applications—from semantic search to autonomous systems—has made the latency and inefficiency of legacy data architectures untenable. T100-DB is built to meet these demands head-on.
What to Expect from T100-DB

    For AI and Data Engineers: A paradigm shift in productivity with a unified architecture supporting structured metadata and vector embeddings, enabling powerful, hybrid queries in a single, low-latency call via a seamless Python API.

    For DevOps and SREs: A cloud-native system built for Kubernetes, offering seamless scaling, automated healing, and deep observability. Its focus on energy efficiency and ARM architecture support translates to lower operational costs, with ironclad durability and security built-in.

    For the Industry at Large: A radical lowering of barriers to building the next generation of AI applications, unlocking new possibilities in real-time AI, from hyper-personalized user experiences to sophisticated fraud detection and complex, data-driven decision engines.

Core Technology Stack (High-Level Overview)

T100-DB's power comes from a carefully selected, modern technology stack:

    Julia (The Core Engine): Leveraging its unparalleled performance for complex scientific and numerical computation, providing the raw power for all data operations.

    Python (The API Layer): Exposing a frictionless developer experience and seamless integration with the entire AI and data science ecosystem.

    Go (The CLI & Tooling): Delivering robust, dependency-free, and lightning-fast binaries for automation and management.

    Column-Family Data Model: Optimized for massive, distributed datasets with high write and read throughput, superior to traditional relational models for AI workloads.

    Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW): The state-of-the-art algorithm for high-performance Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search in high-dimensional vector spaces.

    Apache Arrow: Our canonical in-memory data format for high-performance inter-process communication, enabling zero-copy data sharing.

    Aeron: A low-latency, high-throughput messaging transport for critical inter-node communication, ensuring predictable performance and high availability.

    Multi-Layered Data Integrity & Security: Including Write-Ahead Logging (WAL), data checksumming, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and optional End-to-End Encryption (E2EE).

Development Milestones: Path to Stable 1.0 Release

Our development proceeds in three distinct phases, designed to build credibility and traction iteratively:

    Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP): Focused on core, single-node performance and functionality, demonstrating the viability of our technical thesis.

    Phase 2: Private/Public Beta: Introducing distributed capabilities, validating the product with early adopters, and hardening the system.

    Phase 3: Stable 1.0 Release: Achieving a stable, production-ready version of T100-DB, suitable for broad adoption and enterprise use, with rigorous performance optimization and comprehensive security.
